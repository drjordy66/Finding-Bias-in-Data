### Goal

The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of 'bias' through data on Wikipedia articles - specifically, articles on political figures from a variety of countries.

To do this, we will combine a dataset of Wikipedia articles with a dataset of country populations. An intermediary step will be taken with the Wikipedia articles dataset using ORES (_see Relevant API documentation_) to append an article quality prediction.

We will then perform an analysis of how the coverage of politicians on Wikipedia and the quality of articles about politicians varies between countries. The [analyis](/analysis) includes a series of bar graphs and tables depicting the following:

1. 10 highest-ranked countries in terms of number of politician articles as a proportion of country population
2. 10 lowest-ranked countries in terms of number of politician articles as a proportion of country population
3. 10 highest-ranked countries in terms of number of GA and FA-quality articles as a proportion of all articles about politicians from that country
4. 10 lowest-ranked countries in terms of number of GA and FA-quality articles as a proportion of all articles about politicians from that country

In conclusion, I will reflect on how this analysis helps me understand the causes and consequences of bias on Wikipedia.

The wikipedia article dataset, "Politicians by Country from the English-language Wikipedia," was obtained from Figshare on 10/29/2017. It was publicly posted by Oliver Keyes.

The population dataset, "Population Mid-2015," was obtained from the Population Reference Bureau on 10/27/2017. The link for this data is NOT provided and it is NOT included in the repository as it is copyrighted.

### Relevant API documentation

The __ORES ("Objective Revision Evaluation Service") Wikimedia API__ ([documentation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES), [endpoint](https://ores.wikimedia.org/v3/#!/scoring/get_v3_scores_context)) estimates the quality of an article. The quality estimate for an article falls into one of the six following categories:

prediction | description
--- | ---
FA | Featured article
GA | Good article
B | B-class article
C | C-class article
Start | Start-class article
Stub | Stub-class article

### Cleaned data

The [cleaned data](/data_clean) file is in a `.csv` format and contains five columns in the following format:

column name | value
--- | ---
country | str
article_name | str
revision_id | str
article_quality | str
population | str

### Reproducibility

The steps for reproducing this analysis can be found in the [src](/src) directory both in the README.md and the [hcds-a2-bias.ipynb](/src/hcds-a2-bias.ipynb).

### Issues/special considerations

- Combining the datasets removed rows where country names were not uniform. This is intentional and per the instructions of the analysis.

- The [`page_data.csv`](/data_raw) contains revision ids that the ORES API may not find. These articles have most likely been deleted. The API call will list any relevant revision ids that were not found and a prediction value of 'NA' will be inserted into the article quality prediction.
